              After researching the worlds top academies, we are convinced that
              training on a futsal field is the most effective way to develop a
              player's technical skills. Our FIFA-approved surface is fast, fun,
              and optimized for specialized training and competitive play. And
              with 70% less injuries than turf, it's also the safest.

              With a custom-built 15 foot bar, Soccer Hub isn't just about
